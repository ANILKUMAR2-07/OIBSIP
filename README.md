### Project Title: EDA on Retail Sales Data

Idea: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data


Description:

In this project, a dataset containing information about retail sales. The goal is
to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can
help the retail business make informed decisions.

### Project Idea: Cleaning Data
Idea: Cleaning Data


Description:


Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete
data within a dataset. Messy data leads to unreliable outcomes. Cleaning data is an essential
part of data analysis, and demonstrating your data cleaning skills is key to landing a job. Here
are some projects to test out your data cleaning skills:

Key Concepts and Challenges:
Data Integrity: Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout the
cleaning process.
Missing Data Handling: Dealing with missing values by either imputing them or making informed decisions on how to handle gaps in the dataset.
Duplicate Removal: Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain data uniqueness.
Standardization: Consistent formatting and units across the dataset for accurate analysis.
Outlier Detection: Identifying and addressing outliers that may skew analysis or model performance.

Idea: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression


Dataset Link ðŸ”— 


Description:

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate a numerical outcome based on a dataset with relevant features. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm, and this project provides hands-on experience in developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model.


Key Concepts and Challenges:

â€¢Data Collection: Obtain a dataset with numerical features and a target variable for prediction.
â€¢Data Exploration and Cleaning: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, handle missing values, and ensure data quality.
â€¢Feature Selection: Identify relevant features that may contribute to the predictive model.
â€¢Model Training: Implement linear regression using a machine learning library (e.g., Scikit-Learn).
â€¢Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset using metrics such as Mean Squared Error or R-squared.
â€¢Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate the relationship between the predicted and
actual values.


Learning Objectives:

â€¢Understanding of linear regression concepts.
â€¢Practical experience in implementing a predictive model.
â€¢Model evaluation and interpretation skills
